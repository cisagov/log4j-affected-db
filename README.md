CISA urges organizations operating products marked as "Not Fixed" to immediately
implement alternate controls, including:

- Install a WAF with rules that automatically update.
- Set `log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups` to true by adding `-Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=True`
  to the Java Virtual Machine command for starting your application.
- Ensure that any alerts from a vulnerable device are immediately actioned.
- Report incidents promptly to CISA and/or the FBI [here](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/report).
