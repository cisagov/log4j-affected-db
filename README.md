## Mitigation Guidance ##

When updates are available, agencies must update software
using Log4j to the newest version, which is the most
effective and manageable long-term option. Where
updating is not possible, the following mitigating
measures can be considered as a temporary solution
and apply to the entire solution stack.

- **Disable Log4j library.** Disabling software using the
Log4j library is an effective measure, favoring
controlled downtime over adversary-caused issues.
This option could cause operational impacts and limit
visibility into other issues.
- **Disable JNDI lookups or disable remote codebases.**
This option, while effective, may involve
developer work and could impact functionality.
- **Disconnect affected stacks.** Solution stacks not
connected to agency networks pose a dramatically
lower risk from attack. Consider temporarily
disconnecting the stack from agency networks.
- **Isolate the system.** Create a “vulnerable network”
VLAN and segment the solution stack from the
rest of the enterprise network.
- **Deploy a properly configured Web Application
Firewall (WAF) in front of the solution stack.**
Deploying a WAF is an important, but incomplete,
solution. While threat actors will be able to
bypass this mitigation, the reduction in alerting
will allow an agency SOC to focus on a smaller
set of alerts.
- **Apply micropatch.** There are several micropatches
available. They are not a part of the official
update but may limit agency risk.
- Report incidents promptly to CISA and/or the FBI
[here](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/report).
