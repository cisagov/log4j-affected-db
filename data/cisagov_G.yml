    notes: Apigee installed Log4j 2 in its Apigee Edge VMs, but the software was not
      used and therefore the VMs were not impacted by the issues in CVE-2021-44228
      and CVE-2021-45046. Apigee updated Log4j 2 to v.2.16 as an additional precaution.
      It is possible that customers may have introduced custom resources that are
      using vulnerable versions of Log4j. We strongly encourage customers who manage
      Apigee environments to identify components dependent on Log4j and update them
      to the latest version. Visit the Apigee Incident Report for more information.

    notes: The AppSheet core platform runs on non-JVM (non-Java) based runtimes. At
      this time, we have identified no impact to core AppSheet functionality. Additionally,
      we have patched one Java-based auxiliary service in our platform. We will continue
      to monitor for affected services and patch or remediate as required. If you
      have any questions or require assistance, contact AppSheet Support.

    notes: Looker-hosted instances have been updated to a Looker version with Log4j  v2.16.
      Looker is currently working with third-party driver vendors to evaluate the
      impact of the Log4j vulnerability. As Looker does not enable logging for these
      drivers in Looker-hosted instances, no messages are logged. We conclude that
      the vulnerability is mitigated. We continue to actively work with the vendors
      to deploy a fix for these drivers.  Looker customers who self-manage their Looker
      instances have received instructions through their technical contacts on how
      to take the necessary steps to address the vulnerability. Looker customers who
      have questions or require assistance, please visit Looker Support.
