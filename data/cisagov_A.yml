      address the vulnerability. This patch release adds the mitigation for CVE-2021-44228
      contained in the Solr package as recommended by Apache Solr group. Specifically,
      it updates the Log4j library to a non-vulnerable version on CentOS 7 systems
      as well as adds the recommended option “$SOLR_OPTS -Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true”
      to disable the possible attack vector on both CentOS 6 and CentOS 7."'

    notes: To help mitigate the impact of the open-source Apache “Log4j2" utility
      (CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046) security issues on customers’ containers,
      Amazon EKS, Amazon ECS, and AWS Fargate are deploying a Linux-based update (hot-patch).
      This hot-patch will require customer opt-in to use, and disables JNDI lookups
      from the Log4J2 library in customers’ containers. These updates are available
      as an Amazon Linux package for Amazon ECS customers, as a DaemonSet for Kubernetes
      users on AWS, and will be in supported AWS Fargate platform versions

      to KCL version 1.14.5 (or higher)

    notes: ActiveMQ Artemis does not use Log4j for logging. However, Log4j 1.2.17
      is included in the Hawtio-based web console application archive (i.e. [web/console.war/WEB-INF/lib](web/console.war/WEB-INF/lib)).
      Although this version of Log4j is not impacted by CVE-2021-44228 future versions
      of Artemis will be updated so that the Log4j jar is no longer included in the
      web console application archive. See [ARTEMIS-3612](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARTEMIS-3612)
      for more information on that task.

    notes: Apache Camel does not directly depend on Log4j 2, so we are not affected
      by CVE-2021-44228.If you explicitly added the Log4j 2 dependency to your own
      applications, make sure to upgrade.Apache Camel does use log4j during testing
      itself, and therefore you can find that we have been using log4j v2.13.3 release
      in our latest LTS releases Camel 3.7.6, 3.11.4.

    notes: Apache Tomcat 9.0.x has no dependency on any version of log4j. Web applications
      deployed on Apache Tomcat may have a dependency on log4j. You should seek support
      from the application vendor in this instance. It is possible to configure Apache
      Tomcat 9.0.x to use log4j 2.x for Tomcat's internal logging. This requires explicit
      configuration and the addition of the log4j 2.x library. Anyone who has switched
      Tomcat's internal logging to log4j 2.x is likely to need to address this vulnerability.
      In most cases, disabling the problematic feature will be the simplest solution.
      Exactly how to do that depends on the exact version of log4j 2.x being used.
      Details are provided on the [log4j 2.x security page](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html)

    notes: Autodesk is continuing to perform a thorough investigation in relation
      to the recently discovered Apache Log4j security vulnerabilities. We continue
      to implement several mitigating factors for our products including patching,
      network firewall blocks, and updated detection signatures to reduce the threat
      of this vulnerability and enhance our ability to quickly respond to potential
      malicious activity. We have not identified any compromised systems in the Autodesk
      environment due to this vulnerability, at this time. This is an ongoing investigation
      and we will provide updates on the [Autodesk Trust Center as we learn more](https://www.autodesk.com/trust/overview).
