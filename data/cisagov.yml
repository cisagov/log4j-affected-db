    notes: As a precaution, Kiteworks released a 7.6.1 Hotfix software update to address
      the vulnerability. This patch release adds the mitigation for CVE-2021-44228
      contained in the Solr package as recommended by Apache Solr group. Specifically,
      it updates the Log4j library to a non-vulnerable version on CentOS 7 systems
      as well as adds the recommended option “$SOLR_OPTS -Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true"
      to disable the possible attack vector on both CentOS 6 and CentOS 7.

    notes: ActiveMQ Artemis does not use Log4j for logging. However, Log4j 1.2.17
      is included in the Hawtio-based web console application archive (i.e. [web/console.war/WEB-INF/lib](web/console.war/WEB-INF/lib)).
      Although this version of Log4j is not impacted by CVE-2021-44228 future versions
      of Artemis will be updated so that the Log4j jar is no longer included in the
      web console application archive. See [ARTEMIS-3612](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARTEMIS-3612)
      for more information on that task.

    notes: Apache Camel does not directly depend on Log4j 2, so we are not affected
      by CVE-2021-44228.If you explicitly added the Log4j 2 dependency to your own
      applications, make sure to upgrade.Apache Camel does use log4j during testing
      itself, and therefore you can find that we have been using log4j v2.13.3 release
      in our latest LTS releases Camel 3.7.6, 3.11.4.

    notes: To clarify and avoid confusion, the 1.14.1 / 1.13.4 / 1.12.6 / 1.11.5 releases,
      which were supposed to only contain a Log4j upgrade to 2.15.0, were skipped
      because CVE-2021-45046 was discovered during the release publication. The new
      1.14.2 / 1.13.5 / 1.12.7 / 1.11.6 releases include a version upgrade for Log4j
      to version 2.16.0 to address CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046.

    notes: Apache Tomcat 9.0.x has no dependency on any version of log4j. Web applications
      deployed on Apache Tomcat may have a dependency on log4j. You should seek support
      from the application vendor in this instance. It is possible to configure Apache
      Tomcat 9.0.x to use log4j 2.x for Tomcats internal logging. This requires explicit
      configuration and the addition of the log4j 2.x library. Anyone who has switched
      Tomcats internal logging to log4j 2.x is likely to need to address this vulnerability.
      In most cases, disabling the problematic feature will be the simplest solution.
      Exactly how to do that depends on the exact version of log4j 2.x being used.
      Details are provided on the [log4j 2.x security page](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html)

    notes: Autodesk is continuing to perform a thorough investigation in relation
      to the recently discovered Apache Log4j security vulnerabilities. We continue
      to implement several mitigating factors for our products including patching,
      network firewall blocks, and updated detection signatures to reduce the threat
      of this vulnerability and enhance our ability to quickly respond to potential
      malicious activity. We have not identified any compromised systems in the Autodesk
      environment due to this vulnerability, at this time. This is an ongoing investigation
      and we will provide updates on the [Autodesk Trust Center as we learn more](https://www.autodesk.com/trust/overview).

    notes: Apigee installed Log4j 2 in its Apigee Edge VMs, but the software was not
      used and therefore the VMs were not impacted by the issues in CVE-2021-44228
      and CVE-2021-45046. Apigee updated Log4j 2 to v.2.16 as an additional precaution.
      It is possible that customers may have introduced custom resources that are
      using vulnerable versions of Log4j. We strongly encourage customers who manage
      Apigee environments to identify components dependent on Log4j and update them
      to the latest version. Visit the Apigee Incident Report for more information.

    notes: Product does not use Log4j 2 and is not impacted by the issues identified
      in CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046. Customers may have introduced a separate
      logging solution that uses Log4j 2. We strongly encourage customers who manage
      Cloud Functions environments to identify components dependent on Log4j 2 and
      update them to the latest version.

    notes: Google Kubernetes Engine does not use Log4j 2 and is not impacted by the
      issues identified in CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046.  Customers may have
      introduced a separate logging solution that uses Log4j 2. We strongly encourage
      customers who manage Google Kubernetes Engine environments to identify components
      dependent on Log4j 2 and update them to the latest version.

    notes: Looker-hosted instances have been updated to a Looker version with Log4j  v2.16.
      Looker is currently working with third-party driver vendors to evaluate the
      impact of the Log4j vulnerability. As Looker does not enable logging for these
      drivers in Looker-hosted instances, no messages are logged. We conclude that
      the vulnerability is mitigated. We continue to actively work with the vendors
      to deploy a fix for these drivers.  Looker customers who self-manage their Looker
      instances have received instructions through their technical contacts on how
      to take the necessary steps to address the vulnerability. Looker customers who
      have questions or require assistance, please visit Looker Support.

    notes: Sonatype uses logback as the default logging solution as opposed to log4j.
      This means our software including Nexus Lifecycle, Nexus Firewall, Nexus Repository
      OSS and Nexus Repository Pro in versions 2.x and 3.x are NOT affected by the
      reported log4j vulnerabilities. We still advise keeping your software upgraded
      at the latest version.
