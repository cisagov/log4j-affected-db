| Apache | ActiveMQ Artemis |  |  | Not Affected | [link](https://activemq.apache.org/news/cve-2021-44228) | ActiveMQ Artemis does not use Log4j for logging. However, Log4j 1.2.17 is included in the Hawtio-based web console application archive (i.e. [web/console.war/WEB-INF/lib](web/console.war/WEB-INF/lib)). Although this version of Log4j is not impacted by CVE-2021-44228 future versions of Artemis will be updated so that the Log4j jar is no longer included in the web console application archive. See [ARTEMIS-3612](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARTEMIS-3612) for more information on that task. |  | [cisagov](https://github.com/cisagov/log4j-affected-db) | 2021-12-21 |

| Apache | Tomcat | 9.0.x |  | Affected | [link](https://tomcat.apache.org/security-9.html) | Apache Tomcat 9.0.x has no dependency on any version of log4j. Web applications deployed on Apache Tomcat may have a dependency on log4j. You should seek support from the application vendor in this instance. It is possible to configure Apache Tomcat 9.0.x to use log4j 2.x for Tomcat's internal logging. This requires explicit configuration and the addition of the log4j 2.x library. Anyone who has switched Tomcat's internal logging to log4j 2.x is likely to need to address this vulnerability. In most cases, disabling the problematic feature will be the simplest solution. Exactly how to do that depends on the exact version of log4j 2.x being used. Details are provided on the [log4j 2.x security page](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html) |  | [cisagov](https://github.com/cisagov/log4j-affected-db) | 2021-12-21 |

Looker is currently working with third-party driver vendors to evaluate the impact of the Log4j vulnerability. As Looker does not enable logging for these drivers in Looker-hosted instances, no messages are logged. We conclude that the vulnerability is mitigated. We continue to actively work with the vendors to deploy a fix for these drivers.  Looker customers who self-manage their Looker instances have received instructions through their technical contacts on how to take the necessary steps to address the vulnerability. Looker customers who have questions or require assistance, please visit Looker Support. |  | [cisagov](https://github.com/cisagov/log4j-affected-db) | 2021-12-18 |
