| Apache | ActiveMQ Artemis |  |  | Not Affected | [link](https://activemq.apache.org/news/cve-2021-44228) | ActiveMQ Artemis does not use Log4j for logging.

Although this version of Log4j is not impacted by CVE-2021-44228 future versions of Artemis will be updated so that the Log4j jar is no longer included in the web console application archive. See [ARTEMIS-3612](https://issues.apache.org/jira/browse/ARTEMIS-3612) for more information on that task. |  | [cisagov](https://github.com/cisagov/log4j-affected-db) | 2021-12-21 |

| Apache | Tomcat | 9.0.x |  | Affected | [link](https://tomcat.apache.org/security-9.html) | Apache Tomcat 9.0.x has no dependency on any version of log4j. Web applications deployed on Apache Tomcat may have a dependency on log4j. You should seek support from the application vendor in this instance. It is possible to configure Apache Tomcat 9.0.x to use log4j 2.x for Tomcat's internal logging. This requires explicit configuration and the addition of the log4j 2.x library. Anyone who has switched Tomcat's internal logging to log4j 2.x is likely to need to address this vulnerability. In most cases, disabling the problematic feature will be the simplest solution. Exactly how to do that depends on the exact version of log4j 2.x being used. Details are provided on the [log4j 2.x security page](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html) |  | [cisagov](https://github.com/cisagov/log4j-affected-db) | 2021-12-21 |
