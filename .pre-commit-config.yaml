      # There are ongoing issues with how this command works. This issue

      # https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/issues/21408
      # We have seen issues primarily with proxy providers and Terraform code
      # that uses remote state. The PR
      # https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/pull/24887
      # has been approved and is part of the 0.13 release to resolve the issue
      # with remote states.
      # The PR
      # https://github.com/hashicorp/terraform/pull/24896
      # is a proprosed fix to deal with `terraform validate` with proxy
      # providers (among other configurations).
      # We have decided to disable the terraform_validate hook until the issues
      # above have been resolved, which we hope will be with the release of
      # Terraform 0.13.
